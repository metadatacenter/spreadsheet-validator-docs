# Generate Repaired Spreadsheet

The "Download" button to generate the repaired spreadsheet is located at the bottom right corner and two options are available, "Download as Excel" or "Download as TSV" to choose.

Note that if you submit a TSV file as the input earlier, then only the option "Download as TSV" is available.
