# Repair Missing Values

An empty spreadsheet cell where a value is required produces a "missing value" error. This error falls under a broader category of completeness errors recognized by the tool's algorithm. Repairing this type of error requires you to manually fill in the empty cell.

Selecting one of the error options on the navigation bar will direct you to the worksheet page where you can perform the needed fix.

- (B) "Batch Repair Field" = Enter the correct value in this field to update ALL displayed rows with this value. Press [ENTER] to apply the update.
- (C) "Filter Field" = Enter a string in a specific column to limit the displayed rows to those that contain that string.
- (D) "Save" and "Save and Repair Next" = The first button saves changes without leaving the page. The second button saves the changes and advances you to the next error problem.
- (E) "Page Limit" = Select a number of rows to display per worksheet page.
