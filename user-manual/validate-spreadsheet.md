Once you have uploaded the input file, click "Start Validating" to begin the validation process. Depending on the file size and your Internet connection, the process may take some time.

## Validation Dashboard

The Validation Dashboard displays an overall validation summary and information about the number and types of validation errors that the tool's algorithm detected in your spreadsheet.
